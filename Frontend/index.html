          Software vulnerabilities are one of the main causes of security in a software development process. They are the flaws or deficiencies in the design of software programs or mistakes in their implementation. These weaknesses leads to a number of cyber-crimes, the attacker can exploit the application vulnerability to target on softwareâ€™s integrity, confidentiality, authentication and validity. Detecting vulnerabilities in a software is a crucial step which can be done either in the production phase itself by statistically auditing the source code or dynamically at the run time. The scope of this application is limited to statistical analysis of source code which can be extended to dynamic analysis of source code to detect vulnerabilities.

        The aim of this application is to introduce deep learning for vulnerability detection as this method has great potential because it does not need human experts to manually define the features which automates the detection process. The deep learning approach uses a huge data of software programs which includes vulnerable as well as non-vulnerable programs covering different vulnerabilities to identify the patterns for detection.
